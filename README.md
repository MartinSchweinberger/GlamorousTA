# Glamourous Introduction to Texty Analytics (Part 2)

Martin Schweinberger (University of Queenalnd, 16 October, 2024)

## General Information

This two-part workshop series introduces participants to basic text analytics for research using Reddit data

Part 1: Wednesday 9 October, 1:00 - 3:00 pm AEST
Part 2: Wednesday 16 October, 1:00 - 3:00 pm AEST

### Content

In the first workshop, we focus on data collection and you will learn how to collect posts from Reddit - using the very sparkly example of the Eurovision Song Contest.

In the second workshop, you will learn to apply a range of text analytic techniques to the Reddit data. 

Some experience with R coding is preferred for attending the series. No experience with social media data collection or text analysis is required.

### Providers

This workshop series is delivered by the Australian Digital Observatory (ADO) and the Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) and is supported by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC).

The Australian Digital Observatory is a national infrastructure for accessing and analysing dynamic human data on the web such as social media data. It provides an ecosystem of resources such as databanks, data-related services, and expertise to Australian researchers. The Language Data Commons of Australia is an integrated national infrastructure that supports language research. It provides access to nationally significant collections of written, spoken, multi-modal, and signed text for academic and non-academic use.

### Resources

All resources (including the data we will use and analyse, the link to the script for this workshop, and  links to more in-depth resources for further study) are available via this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/GlamorousTA).

To got beyond or review what are are doing in more detail, check out the R [Basics](https://ladal.edu.au/tutorials.html#2_R_Basics) and [Text Analysis](https://ladal.edu.au/tutorials.html#5_Text_Analytics) tutorials offered by the [*Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory* (LADAL).](https://ladal.edu.au)

### Audience

The intended audience for the second part of the workshop is beginner-level, with no previous experience using R. However, the workshop will also be useful for intermediate and advanced users of R if they do not have substantive experience in analyzing text data with R. Thus, no prior knowledge of R is required.

If you want to know more, would like to get some more practice, or would like to have another approach to R, please feel free to check out on eof the various online resources available to learn R (you can check out a very recommendable introduction [here](https://uvastatlab.github.io/phdplus/intror.html)). 

### What to do before the workshop

In this workshop you will learn  (basic) R skills to perform basic text analytics. If you have no or little experience with this, you *can* (but *do not need or have to*) prepare or refresh your R skills by having a look at these tutorials:

* [Getting started with R](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html)

* [Handling tables in R](https://slcladal.github.io/table.html)


You can follow this workshop in different ways - you can sit back and watch it like a lecture or take a more active role - that said, the intention for this workshop is clearly to be practical so that I show something and then you do it on you computer and we have exercises where you can try out what you have just learned. Choose which option suits you best and then go with it.
